# how to specify a job, a contact test job, the channel map,
# and the environment. The contact test job is used mainly with
# the KLA integrator software.

# Select the TSKAPM90A driver. The name, in this case "TSKAPM90A," must be
# the name of a valid handler/prober driver. To see a list of valid names,
# view the pulldown list on the Equipment Select Control on SimpleOI.

# Now set up the Datalog options. Datalog setup is read from a file called
# ProbeDatalogSetup. If the file is not found, an error is raised.
# We will datalog to an ASCII file (IG-XL will create the file name) and
# to an STDF file called MySTDFFile (which will appear in the directory
# where the job was loaded from). Retested devices will appear in the datalog,
# and we will also display datalog in a window.

# Now set up the contact test keywords.
#
# These are mainly used for KLA integrator software with the Tester
# Service Daemon (TSD). If the TSD sees bin 1 returned, it sends
# Integrator a code indicating all pins are making contact; if it
# receives bin 3, it returns a code indicating some pins make contact;
# bin 0 indicates no pins make contact.

#AllPinsContact         1
